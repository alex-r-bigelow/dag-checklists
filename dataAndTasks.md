# Task abstraction

## User tasks (Employee)
- Choose your own adventure for checking boxes off
  - new boxes may show up / become enabled as dependencies are satisfied

## Admin tasks (Manager / HR person)
- Create + wire nodes together
- For each node, create a checklist
- Visualize all Users' progress

- *cool future features*
  - connect to an API that can auto-check things
    - e.g. Zapier
  - send (email? sms?) notifications when users check boxes and/or finish a node

# Data abstraction
- DAG
  - Each node has an associated checkbox
